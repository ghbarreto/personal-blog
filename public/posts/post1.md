Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pelé, is a retired Brazilian soccer player widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. He is the all-time leading goalscorer for Brazil, and was a key member of the Brazilian national team that won three World Cups (1958, 1962, and 1970).

Pelé was born in Três Corações, Brazil on October 23, 1940. As a child, he played soccer with a sock stuffed with newspaper and was constantly practicing his skills. He joined his first club team, Santos, at the age of 15 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a professional player in 1956.

Pelé's professional career took off in 1958, when he helped lead Brazil to their first ever World Cup victory at the age of 17. He scored a hat-trick (three goals) in the semi-final match against France, and then scored two goals in the final against Sweden to secure the win. He was the youngest player to ever score in a World Cup final, and his performance earned him the nickname "The King of Soccer."

Pelé continued to dominate the soccer world, leading Brazil to World Cup victories in 1962 and 1970. He scored a total of 12 goals in World Cup play, and is the only player to have won three World Cup titles.

In addition to his success on the international stage, Pelé also had a highly successful club career. He played for Santos from 1956 to 1974, scoring over 1,000 goals in his time with the team. He also played for the New York Cosmos in the North American Soccer League from 1975 to 1977.

Pelé's skill on the field was matched by his sportsmanship and charisma off the field. He was known for his humble and gracious attitude, and was beloved by soccer fans around the world. He was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee in 1999, and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame and the National Soccer Hall of Fame in the United States.

Pelé's legacy in the world of soccer is undeniable. He is remembered as one of the greatest players of all time and his contributions to the sport will be forever remembered.
